## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

> **Found a security vulnerability?** Please do **not** open a bug report, issue, or PR for it — follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) to submit a private vulnerability advisory instead.

Before creating bug reports, please check the issue list as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title**
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem**
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps**
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why**
* **Include screenshots/logs if possible**
* **Include your environment details** (OS, Node version, etc.)

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, please include:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title**
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement**
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**
* **Describe the current behavior and expected behavior**
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful**

### Pull Requests

* Fill in the required template
* Follow the project's style guides (ESLint/Prettier for JavaScript)
* Include appropriate test cases
* Update documentation as needed (README.md, DEPLOYMENT.md)
* End all files with a newline

## Style Guides

### JavaScript/React Style Guide

The frontend uses ESLint and Prettier:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format
```

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Example:

```text
Add peer cleanup on subscription expiry

- Deactivate WireGuard peers for expired subscriptions
- Reconcile active peer counts on VPN servers

Fixes #123
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Writing Tests

* Write tests for all new features
* Aim for >80% code coverage
* Use descriptive test names

### Test Locations

Frontend tests are colocated under `frontend/src/` and run with Vitest:

```text
src/components/
├── Button.jsx
└── Button.test.jsx
```

## Documentation

* Update README.md if you change functionality
* Update DEPLOYMENT.md if you change deployment procedures

2. If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated
3. A project maintainer will review your code and may request changes or improvements
4. Once approved, your code will be merged into the main branch
